The mandatory knowledge base documents and reference implementation files are not present in the provided directory. Please provide access to the following files before I can generate compile-ready automated test scripts:
- Framework Understanding Document.docx
- Framework Rules.docx
- Framework Core Files.txt
- Locators.txt
- Screen Flow Document.docx
- Reference implementation files (Features, StepDefinitions, Pages)
Without these, I cannot proceed as per the strict framework boundaries and override rules.
